twitter bot that lets you play pokemon via DM

DM it your move and then it'll run it and post the image to twitter

see it in action ( twitter.com/twplayspokemon, bot is offline now and for the foreseeable future)

twitter is dying probably and the API limits screwed everything up, also the bot didn't get much traction at all

so have at it
